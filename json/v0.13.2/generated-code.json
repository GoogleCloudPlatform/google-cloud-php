Many services in Google Cloud PHP offer a generated\nclient in addition to the base client.<\/p>\n<p>These generated clients are used by Google Cloud PHP under the hood to communicate with\nGoogle Cloud services via gRPC. They are also available for use directly by you.<\/p>\n<h3>Should I Use a Generated Client?<\/h3>\n<p>If you require a specific version of an API, the Generated Code may be best. Google\nCloud PHP libraries generally use the latest version of an API. The Generated Code clients\nare also much closer to a 1:1 API client. If you are familiar with the specifics\nof a service, vkit may be more familiar to you. Google Cloud PHP clients attempt\nto provide simple, language-idiomatic access to Google Cloud services over a\ndirect mapping.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the requirements for using Generated Code clients?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Using Generated Code requires the <a href=\"https:\/\/pecl.php.net\/package\/gRPC\">gRPC PHP extension<\/a>\nto be enabled on your server.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/body>","methods":[]}
