# What is Veneer Toolkit?

Veneer Toolkit clients are generated by Google engineers for each language, and
are used to communicate directly with a specific version of a service via
[gRPC](https://grpc.io). Many services in Google Cloud PHP offer a veneer
toolkit (vkit) client in addition to the base client.

Veneer Toolkit is used by Google Cloud PHP under the hood to communicate with
Google Cloud services via gRPC. They are also available for use directly by you.

### Should I Use Veneer Toolkit?

If you require a specific version of an API, Veneer Toolkit may be best. Google
Cloud PHP libraries generally use the latest version of an API. Veneer Toolkit
is also much closer to a 1:1 API client. If you are familiar with the specifics
of a service, vkit may be more familiar to you. Google Cloud PHP clients attempt
to provide simple, language-idiomatic access to Google Cloud services over a
direct mapping.

### What are the requirements for Veneer Toolkit?

* Veneer Toolkit requires the [gRPC PHP extension](https://pecl.php.net/package/gRPC)
to be enabled on your server.
