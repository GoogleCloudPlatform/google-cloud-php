```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).

### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/blob/master/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.
