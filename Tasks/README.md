### Installation

To begin, install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

Now to install just this component:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud-tasks
```

Or to install the entire suite of components at once:

```sh
$ composer require google/cloud
```

This component supports both REST over HTTP/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)
please see our [gRPC installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc).


### Authentication

Please see our [Authentication guide](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-php/blob/master/AUTHENTICATION.md) for more information
on authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.

### Sample

```php
```

### Version

This component is considered alpha. As such, it is still a work-in-progress and is more likely to get backwards-incompatible updates.

### Next Steps
